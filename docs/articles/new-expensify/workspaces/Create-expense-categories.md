keywords: [New Expensify, expense categories, GL codes, payroll codes, chart of accounts, import categories, expense coding]
internalScope: Audience is Workspace Admins. Covers creating, importing, enabling, and managing expense categories, including GL and payroll codes. Does not cover personal expense rules or accounting integration setup.

In Expensify, categories represent your **chart of accounts, GL accounts, expense accounts**, or other financial coding used for reporting and accounting.

Workspace Admins can create categories manually, or import them automatically when connecting an accounting system such as QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, or Sage Intacct. Once categories are available, they can be enabled or disabled as needed. Over time, Expensify also learns how categories are applied to specific merchants and suggests them automatically.

The Categories table displays the category **Name**, **GL Code** (if assigned), and whether it's **Enabled** for workspace members to use.

# How to configure Category Rules

Category Rules let you control how specific categories behave. You can require additional information, assign approvers, or set spending thresholds for individual categories.

To manage Category Rules:

1. In the **navigation tabs** (on the left on web, and at the bottom on mobile), click **Workspaces**.
2. Click your **workspace name**.
3. Click **Categories**.
4. Select a category to open its settings panel.

Available Category Rule options include:

- **Approver** – Assign a specific approver for expenses in this category.
- **Default tax rate** – Set a default tax percentage ([Taxes](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/workspaces/Track-Taxes) must be enabled on the workspace).
- **Flag amounts over** - Set a spending cap for this category.
- **Require receipts over** – Set a threshold for when receipts are required.
- **Require itemized receipts over** – Require itemized receipts for expenses over a specific amount.
- **Require fields** - Require specific fields be completed for this category. The options are:
   - **Require description** - Force members to enter a reason when using the category.
   - **Require attendees** - Force members to add additional attendees when using the category.

Category Rules apply to all members who use that category. If both a Category Rule and a Workspace Rule apply to the same expense, the Category Rule takes priority.

# How to apply categories automatically

Expensify offers two ways to automatically apply categories based on merchant:

## Learned Categorization

Expensify learns your category preferences over time and suggests them automatically based on the merchant.

- If you manually change a category, Expensify remembers the update.
- Existing expenses are not updated retroactively.
- These suggestions are based on patterns and may vary by user.

## Workspace Merchant Rules

Workspace Admins can configure [**Workspace Merchant Rules**](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/workspaces/Workspace-Merchant-Rules) to apply consistent categories based on merchant name across all workspace members.

- Rules apply across all expenses on the workspace.
- Rules take precedence over learned suggestions.
- If a category is already set manually, Expensify won’t override it.

# FAQ

## Can I edit categories on a submitted expense report?

Yes, until an expense is approved or reimbursed. Approvers can also edit categories—even post-approval—by taking control of the report.

## Can I see an audit trail of category changes?

Yes. When a category is manually edited, the change is logged in the related expense chat.

## What happens if a category is disabled in my accounting system?

It will be removed from the workspace’s category list. However, it will remain visible on previously submitted or drafted reports where it was already applied.

## How can members see GL codes?

GL codes are not visible to members by default. If visibility is required, consider including the GL code in the category name itself.
