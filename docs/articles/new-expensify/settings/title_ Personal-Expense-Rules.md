# Personal Expense Rules

Expense Rules let you automatically categorize and code your expenses based on the merchant name.

If you frequently spend at the same merchants (for example, Uber, Amazon, or Starbucks), you can create a personal Expense Rule so those expenses are categorized, tagged, and assigned correctly every time.

## What Personal Expense Rules Do

Personal Expense Rules:

- Automatically update expenses when the merchant name matches your rule
- Apply settings like Category, Tag, Tax rate, Description, Reimbursable, Billable, or Report assignment
- Only affect your expenses

This helps you save time and keep your expense reporting consistent.

## How Expense Rules Are Applied

Expense Rules work as follows:

- Rules match based on whether the merchant name contains the text you entered
- Rules apply automatically when expenses are created
- If multiple rules match, they apply from top to bottom
- Personal Expense Rules override [Workspace Merchant Rules](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/workspaces/Workspace-Merchant-Rules)

Rules do not apply retroactively unless you manually update existing expenses.

## How to Automatically Categorize Expenses by Merchant

This is helpful for subscriptions, travel vendors, software tools, and recurring purchases.

# FAQ

## What if I have rules in both Expensify Classic and New Expensify?

Personal Expense Rules are account-based. If you’ve used both experiences, your rules will continue applying to your expenses. 

## Can I apply an Expense Rule to existing expenses?

No. Expense Rules apply when expenses are created. They do not automatically update past expenses. You’ll need to manually edit existing expenses if needed.

## What happens if my personal rule conflicts with a Workspace Merchant Rule?

Your Personal Expense Rule takes precedence. Workspace Merchant Rules apply only if no personal rule overrides the expense.
